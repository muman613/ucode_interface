README
================================================================================

This readme describes the test interface project. The purpose of this project
is to demonstrate how the host interfaces with the video microcode. The source-
code is provided in the src directory.

The application performs the following operations:

1) Loads the video microcode into memory.
2) Stops/Resets/Starts the DSP video engine.
3) Initializes the DRAM interface memory structures.
4) Sets the video decoder profile and sends uninit/init/play command to microcode.
5) Fills the input bitstream fifo with data from video stream.

================================================================================
RUNNING TEST_INTERFACE
================================================================================

The executable application generated by the Makefile is passed a path to the
video microcode and a path to a video input stream.

test_interface -b video_microcode_SMP8910_release.bin -s test100.h264 

This will load the video microcode contained in the video_microcode_SMP8910_release.bin 
file and play the test100.h264 H264 stream.

FILES
================================================================================

dbgimplementation.c			Contains functions to output debug information.
mmimplementation.c			Contains memory management functions.
test_interface.c			Contains main entry point and functions for 
							interfacing with video microcode.
ucode_load_microcode.c		Contains functions for loading microcode into memory.
utils.c						Contains miscellaneous functions.
video_interface.c			Contains low-level functions for video microcode interface.


================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

The file 'aliases.sh' contains several useful aliases to initialize, read, write,
and start/stop the DSP. Also commands for sending init/play/stop to the microcode.
