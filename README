Source scripts/env.sh to add scripts to the path.

Interface implementations can be found in interface1, interface2, and interface3

The master make system is located in the 'Build' sub-directory.

Components used by the project are located in the 'Components' sub-directory.

Documentation can be found in the 'doc' sub-directory.

smpProbe related configuration files are stored in the 'probe' sub-directory.

Microcode used by the interface must be installed in the 'ucode' sub-directory.

XML files such as the platform databaes are stored in the 'xml' sub-directory.

Each sub-project has it's own 'Makefile' in it's directory. The build system
is sensitive to a few ENVIRONMENT variables such as:

ARCH      	Specify whether to build for x86 (32bit) or x86_64 (64bit)
DEBUG		If DEBUG is defined then the target is a debug object.

Each sub-project has a Bash script named 'makeall.sh' which will do a clean
build for each supported target {Release x86_64, Debug x86_64, Release x86,
Debug x86}.

Helper scripts such as 'build.sh' which are in the path if the 'env.sh' script
is sourced provide the Text UI for building.
